## Purchase-Behavior-Prediction

## Overview
This repository contains data and analysis related to predicting whether a customer will purchase a product or service based on their demographic and behavioral data. It includes datasets, scripts for data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualizations.

## Dataset Used
The primary dataset used in this analysis is sourced from [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sanyamgoyal401/customer-purchases-behaviour-dataset/data]. It includes a set of features such as age, gender, income, education level, region, loyalty status, purchase frequency, purchase amount, product category, promotion usage, and satisfaction score.

## Introduction
The objective of this project is to build a decision tree classifier to predict customer purchase behavior based on demographic and behavioral data. The analysis includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization of the decision tree.

## Features
- Preprocessing of demographic and behavioral data
- Training of a decision tree classifier
- Evaluation of the model using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report
- Visualization of the decision tree

## Data
The data used in this analysis is included in the data directory. 
he primary dataset used in this analysis includes the following features:

- age: Age of the customer
- gender: Gender of the customer (0 for Male, 1 for Female)
- income: Annual income of the customer
- education: Education level of the customer
- region: Region where the customer resides
- loyalty_status: Loyalty status of the customer
- purchase_frequency: Frequency of purchases made by the customer
- purchase_amount: Amount spent by the customer in each purchase
- product_category: Category of the purchased product
- promotion_usage: Indicates whether the customer used promotional offers (0 for No, 1 for Yes)
- satisfaction_score: Satisfaction score of the customer


## Requirements
To run the analysis scripts and visualize the data, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python (version 3.7+)
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Graphviz

You can install the required Python packages using:
- pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn graphviz
